## Demand Selection and Multi-source Interference Task 
### The Multi-source Interference Task (MSIT)

### The Demand Selection Task (DST)
In each DST trial, subjects are asked to make a choice between a certain number of matching MSIT trials and mismatching MSIT trials. Half of the time, the set of MSIT trials chosen will appear, and the subject must complete these trials. Otherwise, a screen will appear stating that the trials were omitted. The choices that the subject is prompted with are decided based on the graph below:

Each distinct choice is shown to the subject twice (once per round for a total of two rounds with an option to break in between rounds).
